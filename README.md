MapReduce:
A mapreduce program based on two functions. The map function create a output for each input, with filtered information and consist of a key and a value. The reduce function combine then the whole output there is assign to the same key.

The TagsViews files combine single tags of a video with the viewer number and the viewer propotion. So we can analyze which tag is very popular. Viewer propotion in this case means the number of views in relation to the number of tags.

The UnixTime files analyze the tags based on one year and consider also the viewer number. So we can analyze the top tags on a year.
